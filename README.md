In this project, we will group clients of an online shop to help the marketing team with their targeting strategies. 

For this, after cleaning and enriching the dataset, we wil reduce the dimension thanks to PCA and t-SNE techniques then apply some unsupervised machine learning (K-Means, DBSCAN, OPTICS).
